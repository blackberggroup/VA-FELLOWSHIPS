  Dr. Elizabeth Dinges is a Clinical Pharmacist and Harm Reduction Coordinator at the VA Illiana Healthcare System and has been serving Veterans within VA since 2007. Dr. Dinges helped pilot VA's first syringe program, in 2017, which was recognized by the VHA Shark Tank Competition. To date, there are over 15 VA facilities who now have safe syringe programs due to her work. Dr. Dinges is viewed as an expert on harm reduction, both within and outside of VA, and has given numerous presentations on improving the delivery of harm reduction services to patients. <br><br>

  Dr. Dinges will be spending her Entrepreneur in Residence Fellowship growing harm reduction offerings and delivery within VA and have it continue to be an exemplar to other federal and health care agencies to follow. Dr. Dinges will be working to add infectious disease and addiction treatment to harm reduction offerings, leaning on her current experience as Harm Reduction Coordinator. Dr. Dinges is partnering on this project with fellow 2024 Entrepreneur in Residence Fellow Dr. Minh Ho.
