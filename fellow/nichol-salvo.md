bio: |
  Dr. Nichol Salvo is the Chief of Podiatry and Limb Preservation Program Director at the Atlanta VA Health Care System. She additionally serves as a faculty member in the PMSR/RRA Podiatry Residency Program at the Atlanta VA. Additionally, as Director of the High-Risk Eye and Limb Preservation Program (HELPP), she works with the VISN 7 Clinical Resource Hub, which provides eye exams, foot exams, and basic foot care services for Veteran patients at increased risk for amputation and blindness. She is recognized as a leader and coalition builder to provide easier access to these services for our nation's Veterans.<br><br>
  
  As a Senior Innovation Fellow, Dr. Salvo's mission is to provide basic foot care to patients at increased risk for amputation, improve access and timeliness of care, and prevent amputation in Veterans, establishing a model of care that can be used nationally across VA. This is to be accomplished by developing a permanent program using telehealth and tele-supervision, which allows podiatrists to serve more patients than in traditional face-to-face clinical settings.
