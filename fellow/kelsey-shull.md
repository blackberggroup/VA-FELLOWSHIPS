  Kelsey Shull began her career at the VA Augusta Health Care System in 2012 as a Recreation Therapy Intern after graduating from Georgia Southern University. After working for the State of Georgia's mental health system for a year, she returned to VA Augusta as the Recreation Therapist on the psychiatric unit where she worked for 7 years.
  
  Shull finished her Master of Healthcare Administration in 2020 and not long after graduation, she completed detail assignments as the Administrative Officer for the Rehabilitation service line and Program Analyst for the Chief of Staff. In April 2021, she accepted the role of Innovation Specialist when VA Augusta joined the VHA Innovators Network. From March 2022 until September 2023, Shull served as the Human-Centered Design Lead for the VHA Innovators Network. As HCD Lead, she trained Innovation Specialists and created national initiatives through Human-Centered Design projects while mentoring VA Augusta innovation investees. Shull was voted Innovation Specialist of the Year by her peers in October 2023. During her HCD Lead tenure, Shull's favorite project was determining the desirability and feasibility for an innovation internship. Now selected as a VHA Innovation Ecosystem Fellow, Shull looks forward to piloting the first VHA Innovation Intern as a Senior Innovation Fellow.
