  As Quality Manager for the National VA-DOD Virtual Diabetes Self-Management Education Program, Mary Julius is responsible for program implementation, dissemination, review, outcome reporting, and evaluation of all phases of the national diabetes self-management training program. Ms. Julius is an expert in diabetes research and care, having brought the first Continuous Glucose Monitors to VA in 2013. Since then, she has been the recipient of a Joint Executive Fund to pilot a VA-DOD Diabetes Self-Management Education Support Program, training health care professionals on how to best support and educate patients and one another on diabetes care. She has been instrumental in growing the program to a combined 27 successful locations, with 39 locations in process.

  As a Senior Innovation Fellow, Ms. Julius is working to expand the program curriculum to include continuous glucose monitoring, engage experts within and outside of VA, expand the program to multiple states, and incorporate a whole health approach to diabetes self-care and management.
