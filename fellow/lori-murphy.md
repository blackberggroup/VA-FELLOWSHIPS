  Lori Murphy is a senior social worker at the Central Ohio VA. At the start of the COVID pandemic, she and 7 other Volunteer Service Specialists and Social Workers developed and implemented VA's Compassionate Contact Corps social prescription program with a goal to reduce Veteran loneliness. Murphy was a VA Diffusion of Excellence Shark Tank Winner in 2021 which helped her to replicate the program from its 8 original sites to 117 and growing. She has been a champion for increasing awareness and education about loneliness, its impact on health, and social prescribing as a solution. Murphy was also selected for the 2024 and 2025 VA Innovation Fellowships and is leading a multi-site pilot of a Social Driver of Health (SDOH) Information Exchange Platform, with the goal to transform VA SDOH care delivery into a more modern, efficient, collaborative approach.
