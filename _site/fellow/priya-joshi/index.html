<p>Dr. Priya Joshi is the Chief Health Informatics Officer at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. She identifies where exclusions in code become exclusions &amp; inconvenience in care. We shouldn&#39;t have to jump through hoops to get the care and resources we need; the best care should be the path of least resistance.
She started her fellowship in 2021 working on developing analytics to proactively identify missed diagnoses of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes to proactively provide upstream medication therapy that prevented kidney disease progression to dialysis, heart attacks, and strokes. She moved forward in 2022 building an enterprise evaluation of food security and building a grocery delivery program called Foodshare that helped get food to Veterans experiencing food insecurity and homelessness. 
She took the skills from the fellowship in building partnerships to get regular and artificial intelligence to the point of care, so Veterans and staff get information and support when and where they need it.
