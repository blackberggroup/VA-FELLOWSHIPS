<p>Dr. Nichol Salvo is the Chief of Podiatry and Limb Preservation Program Director at the Atlanta VA Health Care System. She additionally serves as a faculty member in the PMSR/RRA Podiatry Residency Program at the Atlanta VA. Additionally, as Director of the High-Risk Eye and Limb Preservation Program (HELPP), she works with the VISN 7 Clinical Resource Hub, which provides eye exams, foot exams, and basic foot care services for Veteran patients at increased risk for amputation and blindness. She is recognized as a leader and coalition builder to provide easier access to these services for our nation&#39;s Veterans.
As a Senior Innovation Fellow, Dr. Salvo&#39;s mission is to provide basic foot care to patients at increased risk for amputation, improve access and timeliness of care, and prevent amputation in Veterans, establishing a model of care that can be used nationally across VA. This is to be accomplished by developing a permanent program using telehealth and tele-supervision, which allows podiatrists to serve more patients than in traditional face-to-face clinical settings.
