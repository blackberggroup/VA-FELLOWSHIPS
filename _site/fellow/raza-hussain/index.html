<p>Dr. Raza Hussain serves as the Chief, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) at the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center.  
As an Entrepreneur in Residence, Dr. Hussain worked on Teeth-in-a-Day, a program that aims to redefine OMFS by offering implant-based, immediate load, full-arch prosthodontic rehabilitation of a patient&#39;s entire missing dentition and surrounding soft tissue structures. This method allows an eligible Veteran who is missing all his/her teeth, or who has teeth damaged beyond repair, to have them replaced with an implant retained prothesis in one appointment.
