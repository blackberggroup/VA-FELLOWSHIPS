<p>Dr. Cory Fominaya is National Program Manager for Health Solutions, Population Health focusing on informatics solutions. His interests lie at the intersection of clinical informatics, statistics/mathematics, and outcomes research. As a Senior Innovation Fellow, he worked on creating Machine Learning Decision Support (MLDS). MLDS aims to design efficient cloud architecture and productionize a decision support service utilizing machine learning models to improve Veterans&#39; clinical benefits adjudication.
Supported by the Office of Healthcare Innovation and Learning, the program has undergone four key pilots from proof of concept to autonomous intervention across VISN 9, coordinating with key stakeholders including the Office of Finance Revenue Operations, Pharmacy Benefits Management, Members Services Health Resource Center, and Veterans Benefits Office of Business Oversight Program Integrity Office. The foundational work was completed and submitted to the Diffusion of Excellence Shark Tank Competition in 2016. An early application was scripted to create interactions between the clinicians, and the program was deployed to seven sites. During the next phase, the program performed autonomous interventions at multiple medical centers. Presently, the focus is shifting to codifying machine learning support systems for an enterprise solution capitalizing on integration within the electronic health records using a lightweight human-in-the-loop user interface. The program will support medical centers and administrative staff, enhancing impartiality and justice for Veterans, third-party payers, and VA Medical Centers.
