<p>Dr. Ravi Rasalingam is a Cardiologist at VA Boston Healthcare System and a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School. Though his clinical expertise is in cardiology, Dr. Rasalingam is developing a device for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).  
His innovative project, The Novel Device for Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea, leverages 3D design and printing technologies to produce a custom fit mouthguard as a more comfortable alternative to the CPAP machine. As both an MIT Catalyst Fellow and Entrepreneur in Residence, he worked on producing the first prototypes for the device with follow-on testing, bringing a solution to the very Veterans that inspired him to innovate.
