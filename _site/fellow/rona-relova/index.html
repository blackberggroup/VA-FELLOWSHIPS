<p>Dr. Rona Relova is a Research Health Scientist and Principal Investigator Administrator at VA Palo Alto, where she supervises all aspects of the research programs within the Precision Health Service. Working with research teams, pharmacists, lab and nurse managers, and others, Dr. Relova also directs Veteran-facing operations and cohort development for the VA Genomics Medicine Program (Million Veteran Program) and the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us Research Program). Her work in translational research takes scientific discoveries in the clinic and transforms those findings into new treatments or approaches in medical care that improve Veteran health.
As a Senior Innovation Fellow, Dr. Relova will be expanding the Pharmacogenomics (PGx) Initiative, a clinical program that enables the use of a Veteran&#39;s pharmacogenomic profile to assist with medication management. Pharmacogenetics is the study of how an individual&#39;s genetic make-up affects one&#39;s response to different medications. Knowledge of a patient&#39;s genetic profile may help providers determine an appropriate drug or dose. By utilizing PGx, clinicians are guided in personalized prescribing of medications to improve efficacy or prevent side effects.
