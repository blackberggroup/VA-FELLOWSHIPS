This looks different for each individual fellow, and a benefit of being a member of the Fellowship cohort is being able to communicate and collaborate on your projects. No specific collaboration is required, but it is encouraged.</p>
                            <p class="panel-header">How does VHA Innovation Ecosystem Fellowships program handle certification or credentialing for fellows upon completion of the program?</p>

                            <p class="panel-header">Does the project data need to be specific to VA or can you use data from project implementation in external settings?</p>
                            <p class="panel-body">Your innovation does not need to be restricted to VA, but it must have been implemented in at least one VA facility, VISN, or Program Office.</p>
                            <p class="panel-header margin-top-3">Do community-based outpatient clinics (CBOC) count as unique locations?</p>
                            <p class="panel-body">If you have implemented across multiple CBOC sites, it is worth noting in your application without consuming too much space. It's best to focus on the impact of implementation.</p>

                            <p class="panel-header margin-top-3">How are mentors assigned?</p>
                            <p class="panel-body">With VHA Innovation Ecosystem Fellowships approval, VHA Innovation Ecosystem Fellows are welcome to identify their own mentors and invite them to participate in the program. However, if you need assistance, VHA Innovation Ecosystem Fellowships can provide you with a list of potential mentors. Additionally, we may suggest a mentor based on the focus of your project.</p>
                            <p class="panel-header margin-top-3">Can I offer more than one possible mentor?</p>
                            <p class="panel-body">We strongly recommend that you provide a list of potential mentors for VHA Innovation Ecosystem Fellowships. In the application, you can identify individuals, or departments and program offices that align with your project and would serve as suitable mentors.</p>
