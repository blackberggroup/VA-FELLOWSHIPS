                                            When completing your application, please consider the following:<br><br>

                                            1. Your application will be evaluated on its feasibility, meaningfulness, and strategic value to VHA.<br><br>

                                            2. Review the Application Guide to prepare your responses. Please refrain from using images or tables in the application.<br><br>

                                            3. To protect the privacy of VHA patients and those who care for them, do not include any Protected Health Information (PHI). To learn more about PHI and the importance of protecting, visit <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html">this link</a>.<br><br>

                                            4. VHA Innovation Ecosystem Fellowships support innovation projects at different stages of implementation, and therefore do not require the same level of existing data as other VHA IE programs. However, applicants must still demonstrate the value of their project and explain the data they will use to report on their progress during the fellowship year.<br><br>

                                            5. If possible, provide details on the user experience for your target population (e.g., Veterans, employees, caregivers)<br><br>
